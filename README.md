# Home-Lab
<h1>Overview and Topology</h1>
<p>The goal of my home lab is to simulate a small-scale enterprise environment to gain hands-on experience with IT and sysadmin tasks. I'll focus on deploying and managing an Active Directory environment, configuring domain controllers, managing user accounts, and implementing group policies. I will also integrate workstations, set up file and print services, configure DNS and DHCP, and ensure network security with firewalls, VLANs, and VPNs. Using pfSense to segment the lab from my home network, this setup will prepare me for entry-level IT roles and certifications like CompTIA Network+.</p>



<h1>Centrolized Ubuntu</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>To install Ubuntu and set up a comprehensive remote management environment, start by installing Ubuntu on your computer. Once Ubuntu is installed, set up SSH for secure command-line access, and configure VNC alongside Ubuntu's built-in Remote Desktop for graphical remote control. Lastly, install VMware Workstation to enable virtualization and manage additional operating systems and environments within your Ubuntu setup. This combination will provide a robust platform for remote management and virtualization tasks.</p>
